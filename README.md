<h1>PAL - your palette generator that picks colors friendly for color vision deficiencies.</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Nowadays, color vision deficiencies, also known as color blindness, are relatively common and affect a significant portion of the population worldwide. This condition, characterized by the inability to perceive certain colors or distinguish between them accurately, can range in severity from mild to severe, impacting individuals' daily lives and activities that rely on color perception.<b>PAL</b> is a palette generator React Native application that suggests engaging palettes to users based on a base color or from a photo. The application will then demonstrate how each color is perceived by different types of color vision deficiencies (CVDs): protanomaly, deuteranomaly, and tritanomaly. </p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>This app includes two parts: the front end and the back end. I designed the app's interface with Figma, then coded with React Native and prototyped with Expo Go. For the back end, I used different algorithms as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Color conversion between HEX and RGB and between RGB and RYB</li>
<li>Palette generation from a color: Monochromatic, Complementary, Analogous, Triadic, and square tetradic</li>
<li>Palette generation from a photo: k-mean clustering</li>
<li>Color vision deficiencies demonstration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here is a walk-through video of my final application: </p>
