<h1>PAL - your palette generator that picks colors friendly for color vision deficiencies.</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Nowadays, a significant percentage of the global population is affected by color vision deficiencies, commonly known as color blindness. The severity of this condition, which affects people's everyday lives and activities that depend on color perception, can range from minor to severe. It is characterized by the inability to sense particular colors or to distinguish between them accurately. <b>PAL</b> is a palette generator React Native application that suggests engaging palettes to users based on a base color or from a photo. The application will then demonstrate how each color is perceived by different types of color vision deficiencies (CVDs): protanomaly, deuteranomaly, and tritanomaly. </p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>This app includes two parts: the front end and the back end. I designed the app's interface with Figma, then coded with React Native and prototyped with Expo Go. For the back end, I used different algorithms as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Color conversion between HEX and RGB and between RGB and RYB</li>
<li>Palette generation from a color: Monochromatic, Complementary, Analogous, Triadic, and square tetradic</li>
<li>Palette generation from a photo: k-mean clustering</li>
<li>Color vision deficiencies demonstration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here is a walk-through video of my final application: </p>
